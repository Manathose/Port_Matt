      Block elements
        <div>, <seciton> <p> <h1-h6> <ol> <ul> <form> <blockquoute> 
        They will always start at the next availble line. 
        respect the margin and padding of their parent containers. Block elements are used to contain inline elements.
        

       inline elements: only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content
       <button> <input> <lable> <img> <textarea> <span> 
        inline elements can not be given a height or width.
